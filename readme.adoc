== Description

[WARNING]
====
Since gitea does not support relative links for asciidoc files, I have used
absolute links instead. This means that they will not work for mirrors.
====

This overlay is a work in progress.

It is intended for use with amd64 systems with a strong focus on the musl/llvm
profile.

=== Notes

==== net-libs/nodejs
1. Removes gcc dependency.

==== www-client/chromium

[WARNING]
====
This will not compile against musl unless you have cdefs.h and execinfo.h. These
libraries **should not be installed** on your system as it will cause conflicts
with build systems. In the future I will implement a function within the ebuild
that will sort this out.
====

1. Includes patches for musl.
2. Includes patches from Trivalent and Vanadium.
