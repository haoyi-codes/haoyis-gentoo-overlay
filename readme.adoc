== Description

This repository contains various patches for software intended to run on
amd64 systems with a primary focus on getting packages to work with the musl/llvm profile.

This overlay is a work in progress.

=== Notes

1. www-client/chromium will not compile against musl unless you have cdefs.h,
   tree.h and execinfo.h. These libraries should not be installed on your system
   as it prompt packages to use them and cause breakages. A solution would be to
   install them first, compile chromium, then uninstall them. I plan on creating
   this function built into the ebuild as a temporary fix until we can fully
   patch out chromium's reliance on glibc specific libraries.
