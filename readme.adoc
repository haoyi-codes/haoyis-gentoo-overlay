== Description

This overlay is a work in progress.

It is intended for use with amd64 systems with a strong focus on the musl/llvm
profile.

=== Notes

==== net-libs/nodejs
1. Removes gcc as a dependency.

==== www-client/chromium
*Warning:* This will not compile against musl unless you have cdefs.h, tree.h
and execinfo.h. These libraries **should not be installed** on your system as it
will cause conflicts with build systems. In the future I will implement a
function within the ebuild that will sort this out.

1. Includes patches for musl.
2. Includes hardening patches from hardened-chromium and Vanadium.
