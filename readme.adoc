== Description

[WARNING]
====
Since gitea does not support relative links for asciidoc files, I have used
absolute links instead. This means that they will not work for mirrors.
====

This overlay is a work in progress.

It is intended for use with amd64 systems with a strong focus on the musl/llvm
profile.

=== Notes

==== net-libs/nodejs
1. Removes gcc dependency.
